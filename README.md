# Sales-Predection

I have participate in an internship conducted by CodSoft. My Challenge is to build a model that predict the forecasting amount of a product that customers will purchase, taking into account various factors such as advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection.
This was a beginner level ML model training for understanding the concept of ML Algorithm 

The sales prediction ML model is the best example for the supervised learning for the regressive algorithm.
